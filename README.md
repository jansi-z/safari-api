## About

The API for a real-time game, built with [Feathers](http://feathersjs.com). The game is about guessing animals from blurred images. This API works in tandem with this client: https://github.com/shakahari/animal-safari

This project taught us a lot about using real-time socket.io connections to build a real-time game.
